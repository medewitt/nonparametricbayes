# Nonparametric Bayes

This repository contains scripts detailed in <http://www.robertgrantstats.co.uk/non-parametric-bayes-updating.html> and mentioned in this Stan Discourse post <https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/non-parametric-bayesian-updating/25428>.

I am breaking out the Stan code into separate files and migrating to CmdStanR.
I'll likely be exploring this approach to understand implications for fittings and updating longer time series, etc.
